A quick little app to get clean map screenshots

Sometimes, when you're designing an interface, you need a MKMapView to drop in to your screens - so you need a screenshot of a map. Except: Maps.app displays points of interest, buildings, and other things - and it has a status bar and a few other tidbits on the map.

So, I made a suuuper tiny little universal app that works on iPhone and iPad. It just shows a big ol' map, without any status bar, points of interest, buildings, or the user's location:

Of course, if you'd like to turn those annotations and UI elements back on, just shake the phone (or press CMD+CTRL+Z in the iOS Simulator), where you'll find handy toggles for all of 'em.
